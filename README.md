# Project Description

We intended to make a working simulation of a national economy based off of models.

# Intended usage:

At the start screen, you are presented with multiple nations. Pick any one, and you will enter their national setup, with values already set in. Each nation has its own unique situation (Like Japan and its debt), but it is your duty to make sure the nations survive all economic problems.

Once selected, you will be given a table of values (Max Tax Bracket, Interest Rates, Manufacturing Spending, Welfare Spending, Healthcare Spending, Salaries, Military Spending, Other) that can be manipulated. These require value inputs, and Turn End will not trigger until you have valid inputs for all of these. Your last inputs will remain inside these boxes. Additionally, a text box showcases aspects of your economy, including your interest rate and your National Debt, to allow you to make better decisions.

Once you begin, hit Turn End to move to the next year and factor in your decisions. An event may pop up that will impact your economy, with certain negative or positive effects. Beyond that, you continue playing and need to aim to keep your joy above 20. Go below, and its game over.

Have Fun!
