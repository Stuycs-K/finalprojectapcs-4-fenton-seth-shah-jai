### 2025-05-22 
Wrote much of nationStates early functions and the constructor we will probably use for most applications, also wrote a Bonds class, will update prototype later for why that decision was made. Probably took about an hour fifteen minutes, maybe a little more across class time and homework time. Will work a bit more on nationState functions today now that I've fixed all compilation errors, probably another thirty or so minutes.

### 2025-05-26
Wrote more nationStates functions, will clean up GDP Growth tonight once I figure out by sector additions to GDP and then will have a pretty damn good nationStates class minus potential algorithmic changes later on, which will be perfect to do the next phase of the project with. 

### 2025-05-27
Cleaned up nationState GDP Growth, took longer then expected to manage sector by sector growth, joy calculations and inflation.

### 2025-05-28
Spent all day reworking national debt handling, but now it mostly looks pretty normal. Modeled debt traps with joy decrease but might need to come up with better punishments later on. Still pretty solid though.

### 2025-05-29
Finally finished reworking national debt and joy to make the game better, tinkered with GDP Growth rate to fix the lack of default multiplying.


### 2025-05-30
Finished bonds completely, went through and tinkered with the internal systems to get GDP growth to look reasonable, it's still decent minus a massive reduction in taxes. 

### 2025-06-02
Finished tinkering with equations, mvp as a terminal game complete now time to convert everything to processing.


### 2025-06-03
Fixed Jai's buttons and text boxes, learned cp5 and focused in on providing a background and the values on screen.

### 2025-06-04
Ported over the entire run function and made it work so it edited everything it needed to edit using the prior infrastructure.

### 2025-06-05
Finally made the entire background setup and fixed the nothing ever happens box.


### 2025-06-06
Crafted the events bug fix which allowed the events.txt file to be read successfully, then spent a bunch of time fixing to merge conflicts.


### 2025-06-07
Spent 8.5 hours hanging out with friends instead of doing prom, was out till like midnight, did nothing.

### 2025-06-08
Added multiple countries functionality and did all the stuff that wasn't programming.
